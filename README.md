# Predicting-EPL-Results-Using-Machine-Learning
I set out to create a prediction model that will accurately predict Premier League Results for the 2022/23 season. 
The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Support Vector Classification (SVC), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). By applying these algorithms to historical Premier League data, the project aims to forecast the outcomes of future matches.

Key Features:

Utilizes a diverse set of machine learning algorithms (SVM, SVC, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN) to predict Premier League results.
Accesses and preprocesses extensive historical Premier League data to train the machine learning models effectively.
Implements feature engineering techniques to extract relevant information and enhance the predictive power of the models.
Evaluates and compares the performance of each algorithm using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Provides insightful visualizations and analysis of the predictions and model performance.
Offers flexibility for users to input their own match data and obtain predictions for upcoming matches.
